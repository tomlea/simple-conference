## Simple teleconferencing system made with twilio in about 30 mins.

I raged out at work over people constantly emailing about conference lines.

“Fuck these fucking fucks” I said, ”How the fuck do we have a limited number of
codes? And why the fuck do we have to keep reusing them?!”, I continued.

“I bet I could do better in about 30 mins.” I hollowly claimed.

@pip2k called me on it.

So I wrote this. It works.

It uses twilio, and lets people conference together based on a one time,
randomly assigned, *totally* random, and definitely not vulnerable key system.

### Setup
Create a twilio account, and point it at http://YOURHOST/conference/welcome.

### Small print:
Any claims about this being awesome are lies. It's totally insecure.
